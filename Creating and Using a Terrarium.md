Creating and Using a Terrarium: A Comprehensive Guide
Introduction
A terrarium is a miniature, self-sustaining ecosystem enclosed in a glass container. It's a great way to bring a bit of nature into your home, especially in Western Australia's climate, where the controlled environment of a terrarium can thrive.
Choosing Plants
For a closed terrarium, consider these plants:
- Moss: Thrives in high humidity and low light conditions.
- Ferns: Small ferns like button ferns adapt well to terrarium environments.
- Air Plants: These don't need soil and can thrive in humid conditions.
Setting Up the Terrarium
- Layering: Start with a layer of pebbles for drainage, followed by activated charcoal to filter the air, and then a layer of potting soil.
- Planting: Make small holes in the soil and carefully place your plants in them.
- Moisture: Water sparingly. The closed environment will recycle moisture.

Maintaining the Terrarium
Monitor the moisture levels in your terrarium. If condensation heavily coats the glass, slightly open the lid for a day to let it dry out.
Enhancing the Ecosystem
Consider introducing small decomposers like springtails. They'll help break down organic matter and maintain your ecosystem's health.
